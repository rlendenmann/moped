 *
 * Driver for the ultrasonic sensor (Ultrasonic Ranging Module HC - SR04).
 * The sensor works by sending out a burst of 8 sonic signals and wait
 * for its reflection. The reflected signals are spread out in function of
 * the distance to the object in front of the sensor. This speed is then
 * used to calculate the distance to the object.
 *
 * The whole chain of events is activated by a short trigger signal
 * (around 10 microseconds) on the sensors incoming pin connection.
