 *
 * This module allows to configure a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) cycle and
 * send repeated pulses. The actual pulse transfer is done using Direct Memory
 * Access (DMA).
 *
 * Important parameters are the cycle period (in microseconds) and the width
 * of the duty cycle (percentage of the cycle that the pulse should be high).
 * The duty cycle values range between 0x0000 and 0x8000, which in practice
 * represents 0% and 100%.
 *
 * It is also possible to set up at which point in the cycle that the pulse
 * should be activated. However it is currently not used.
 *
 * A typical example usage (sets up PWM channel 0 to have a 20ms cycle and a
 * pulse starting at the beginning of each cycle and lasting for half a period):
 * 		PwmSetPeriodAndDuty(0, 20000, 0x4000)
 * If the period has been set up, either PwmSetPeriodAndDuty can continue to be
 * used or only the duty can be changed (for example to reduce the pulse to
 * being active only a quarter of the period):
 * 		PwmSetDuty(0, 0x2000)
